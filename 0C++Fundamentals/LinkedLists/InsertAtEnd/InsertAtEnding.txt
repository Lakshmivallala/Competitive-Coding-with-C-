Initially: head-> node1 -> node2->NULL

Now, new node node3 must be inserted such that

head-> node1 -> node2 -> node3 -> NULL 

For this, create a new node node3, insert data value in it, and point it to NULL
since node3 is now the end of the linked list

head-> node1 -> node2->NULL and we have our node3 -> NULL

If linked list is empty, let head point to new node node3
(head->node3)
Else, we need to change the last node's (node2) link part to node3
We need to traverse the whole linked list to get to this node (node2)

For this, take a temp pointer at head (temp=head)
temp = temp->next until temp->next is not NULL 
(i.e till node2->next = NULL)

Now that we have traversed till node2 using temp, temp points at node2
Using temp, point it to node3: temp->next=node3;
