Initially: head-> one -> two-> three -> NULL

Now, node one must be deleted such that 
head -> two -> three ->NULL

For this, first create a pointer than points to the head i.e the first node (one)
(p,head)->one -> two-> three -> NULL

Now, change head value to head->next (i.e 2nd node or two)

Now, free the node that p is pointing to (i.e node one) to get
head -> two -> three ->NULL
