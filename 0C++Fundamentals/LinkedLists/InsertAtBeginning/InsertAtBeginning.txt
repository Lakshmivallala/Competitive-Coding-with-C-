Initially: head-> node1 -> node2 ---- ->NULL

Now, new node node3 must be inserted such that 

head -> node3 -> node1 -> node2 --- ->NULL

For this, 
1. create and insert data value into node3
2. node3->next to head (i.e node3->next=node1 since head points to node1, 
node3 also points to node1)

Now node3 and head point to node1
(head,node3)->node1->node2 ----- ->NULL

3. Now, change head address value to node3's address such that:
head->node3->node1->node2 ---- ->NULL
