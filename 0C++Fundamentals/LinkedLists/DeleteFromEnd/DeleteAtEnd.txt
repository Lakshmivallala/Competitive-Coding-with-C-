Initially: head-> one -> two-> three -> NULL

Now, node one must be deleted such that 
head-> one -> two-> NULL

We traverse till the last node, free it, change the previous nodes next to NULL

For this, we use two pointers, 
one to reach last node, 
one to reach second last
Then change prev node's address to NULL and free p node
